# Scoring Rules

## Standard Padel Scoring (MVP)

Padel uses the same scoring system as tennis.

### Points (within a game)
- Sequence: **0 → 15 → 30 → 40 → Game**
- At 40-40: **Deuce**
- After deuce: **Advantage** to the team that scores
- If advantage team scores → they win the game
- If non-advantage team scores → back to Deuce

### Games (within a set)
- First team to **6 games** wins the set
- Must win by **2 games** (e.g., 6-4 is valid, 6-5 is not)
- At **6-6** → **Tiebreak**

### Tiebreak
- Points count: **0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...**
- First to **7 points** wins
- Must win by **2 points**
- Serve alternates every 2 points (after the first point)

### Sets (match)
- **Best of 3 sets** (first to win 2 sets wins the match)

### Serving
- Serve alternates every game
- In tiebreak, serve alternates every 2 points (first server serves 1 point, then alternating 2 points each)

## Alternative Formats (v2)

### Golden Point (No Deuce)
- At 40-40, the next point wins the game (no advantage)
- Receiving team chooses which side to receive

### Short Sets
- First to **4 games** wins the set (instead of 6)
- Tiebreak at 4-4

### Single Set Match
- Play only 1 set instead of best of 3

### Super Tiebreak (instead of 3rd set)
- At 1 set each, play a super tiebreak to **10 points** (win by 2) instead of a full 3rd set
